## Game Mechanics

### Basic Rules
- The game generates a random number between 1 and 100
- You have a limited number of attempts based on difficulty level
- After each guess, you'll be told if the number is:
  - **Greater than** your guess
  - **Less than** your guess
  - **Correct** (you win!)

### Game Flow
1. Choose difficulty
2. Make guesses
3. Receive feedback and hints
4. Win or lose
5. View your score
6. Play again or quit

## Difficulty Levels

| Difficulty | Attempts | Description |
|-----------|----------|-------------|
| **Easy** | 10 | Perfect for beginners |
| **Medium** | 5 | Balanced challenge |
| **Hard** | 3 | For the brave-hearted |

## Hints System

The game provides progressive hints to help you narrow down the possibilities. Hints are clearly formatted and separated from the main feedback for easy reading.

- **Hint 1** (Always): Tells you if the number is even or odd
- **Hint 2** (After 2 attempts): Divisibility clues (divisible by 5 or 10)
- **Hint 3** (After 3 attempts): Range information (which quarter: 1-25, 26-50, 51-75, or 76-100)

Example hints:
```
‚ùå Incorrect! The number is greater than 50

üí° Hints:
   ‚Ä¢ The number is odd
   ‚Ä¢ The number is divisible by 5
   ‚Ä¢ The number is in the second quarter (26-50)

```

## High Score Tracking

The game tracks your **best performance** (fewest attempts) for each difficulty level:

- Separate high scores for Easy, Medium, and Hard
- "NEW HIGH SCORE" notification when you beat your previous record
- Shows current best scores after each round
- Scores persist throughout your gaming session

Example output:
```
CURRENT HIGH SCORES:
  Easy: 3 attempts
  Medium: 2 attempts
  Hard: No score yet
```
